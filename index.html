      Hi, I'm Megan. I'm a mom of two sweet humans and one loveable dog. My partner of twenty years is Tim; he works in software development and is almost finished with his private pilot's license. We are homeschoolers--new as of the fall of 2020. I'm still figuring out our school groove, but we definitely trend toward the self-directed, unschooling, and worldschooling philosophies.  In 2021, we started traveling in the states, and, as of the spring of 2022, we are spending time in Europe. For the last decade, we've been based just outside of Columbus, Ohio.

      I have a hefty movement background as a professional ballerina and musical theatre performer, an avid yoga practitioner, a teacher of both dance and yoga, and a choreographer of musicals. I am a lover of all things musical theatre. Yoga has been part of my life since 2006, but my practice has evolved in breadth and intensity, both on and off the mat, since I completed yoga teacher training in 2016.

      Oh yeah, and I went to law school. I graduated in 2010, worked at a big law firm for five months, quit, and never went back. Not on purpose. Life just happened.

      Note: My husband, Tim, and I do our best to avoid algorithmic social sites. Of course, we cannot avoid them completely. We do have a Facebook account under the name "Shepston Overly," but it is only for the purpose of joining groups. To keep our use of social media as limited as possible, we do not accept friend requests. We look forward to getting to know you in the real world!
