        I have been volunteering at Franklinton Farms for a couple of years now, and I love it! My son and I started there in the fall of 2020; I thought it could be a nice way for him and I to contribute and engage in community together. The Volunteer Coordinator there simply sends out a sign-up genius form every month, and you sign up to go help weed the gardens or work the booth at the Farmer's Market. It's super easy, we were able to be outside and active, and feel like we were contributing to something.

        Once we started traveling, I had the opportunity to volunteer as a grant writer. At first, I was simply researching grants assigned to me through a google spreadsheet, determining whether they were a good fit for the farms, and noting the date and deadline type. Recently, I've started writing grants. I mostly copy and paste language from previous grants and then alter it a bit to align with the parameters of the specific grant that I'm working on. I also enjoy this type of volunteer work; it's fun to sit at a computer for a few hours a week and try to find money for such a deserving organization.

          The Project MORE program is a lovely opportunity to work one-on-one with students in schools. In the program, reading mentors sit with one student at a time for thirty minutes each, supporting the student while they work on their reading skills. I participated in this program through my childrens' elementary school. I would simply head in to the classroom where the teacher would hand me a packet with a checklist and all of the materials for the day, and the student and I would sit in the hallway and read together.

          I enjoyed the ease and simplicity of this volunteer opportunity--the teachers would tell me what time to come in, what student to work with, and I would simply follow the list handed to me. I also enjoyed the one-on-one interaction with students, it was fun to chat with them and hear about their day, while also helping to support their reading skills.
