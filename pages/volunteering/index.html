        I have been volunteering at Franklinton Farms for a couple of years now, and I love it! My son and I started there in the fall of 2020; I thought it could be a nice way for him and I to contribute and engage in community together. The Volunteer Coordinator there simply sends out a sign-up genius form every month, and you sign up to go help weed the gardens or work the booth at the Farmer's Market. It's super easy, we were able to be outside and active, and feel like we were contributing to something.

        Once we started traveling, I was excited to have the opportunity to volunteer as a grant writer. At first, I was simply researching grants assigned to me through a google spreadsheet, determining whether they were a good fit for the farms, and noting the date and deadline type. Recently, I've started writing grants. I mostly copy and paste language from previous grants and then alter it a bit to align with the parameters of the specific grant that I'm working on. I also enjoy this type of volunteer work; it's fun to sit at a computer for a few hours a week and try to find money for such a deserving organization.
