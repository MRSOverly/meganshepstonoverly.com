My husband and I are biting the bullet and creating a Facebook account after two years without, but it gives me anxiety. I don't like being on social media. I think its negative consequences vastly outweigh any of the connecting aspects, especially now with so many other technology-based options for connection, like Discord. The monopolistic platform wins out because it's, well, monopolistic, and everyone is there. I feel like I have to go back to join worldschooling groups, but it gives me a trepidatious feeling in the pit of my stomach. I'll keep you posted on how it goes.
