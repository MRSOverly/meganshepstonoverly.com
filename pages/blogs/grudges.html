  <div class = "subtitle">How Should We Interact With Our Grudges?</div>

  <div class = "description">
	How much should we allow ourselves to feel the feelings that we aren’t “supposed to" feel? Guilt. Shame. Irrational fear. Anger. 
  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	This question arises for me often when I am working on processing my parents’ alcoholism, personality and mood disorders. I feel something that I know is not a "good" emotion--I mention having guilt because I'm healthy while both my parents are struggling. Well-meaning friends or family members respond with, “don’t feel that way.” I want to roll my eyes and say something snarky back to them. "No problem. I won't feel that way. I'll just turn my emotion chip off." 
  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	This thought arose in me again a few weeks ago. I’m a member of a local community group called Harry Potter and the Sacred Text. The group derives from a podcast of the same name. (It’s so good, you should check it out! <a href = "https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com"> Here's the link</a>.) In our local group, we read chapters of the Harry Potter books through a different theme each week. Recently, our theme of the week was grudges. 
  </div>

  <div class = "description">
	When I googled “grudge definition,” the first entry stated that a grude is "a persistent feeling of ill-will resulting from a past or present insult or injury." Our group had a great discussion about whether grudges have value, and the group settled on the idea that if the emotion is one we are learning from, it isn’t a grudge. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this idea. 
  </div>

  <div class = "description">
	This thought process led me into two places. First, as I mentioned, I still harbor resentment toward my parents.Sometimes I feel angry at them when I need help with the kids and I can’t find a babysitter. Sometimes, when I'm sad, I feel lonely and resentful too, because I wish I had a parent I could call who would help me feel better. It is definitely a “persistent feeling of ill-will.” It keeps coming up, and I can’t stop it. I would say that constitutes a grudge.
  </div>

  <div class = "description">

	The second place I thought about was from a (now famous) book I read a few years ago, <i>The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind and Body in the Healing of Trauma.</i> The author, Bessel van der Kolk, a therapist, was relating a conversation he had with a patient who had a history of sexual abuse. The patient, discussing the abuse said, “it was my own fault.” He responded with, “Come on, you were just a little girl . . . “ 

  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	His patient’s answer was honest and insightful. She said, “You know, Bessel, . . . after two years I trust you enough to tell you that those comments make me feel terrible. Yes it’s true; I instinctively blame myself for everything bad that happens to the people around me. I know it isn’t rational, and I feel really dumb for feeling this way, but I do.” (To the author’s credit, he says he “genuinely thanked her for her feedback,” and now he really tries to avoid telling his patients that they should not feel the way they feel. In my copy of the book, these quotes are on page 130.)
  </div>

  <div class = "description">
	Bessel’s patient knows it isn’t rational for her to feel guilt about her abuse, but she also knows that she feels guilty about being abused. This lady knows what she is talking about. When we discuss emotional reactions through an intellectual lens, we often try to override our emotions with our rationality. 
  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	There’s a paradox, though, contained in the wisdom of Bessel’s patient. She knows she isn’t supposed to feel something, but she’s also recognizing that she’s feeling it. For me, the recognition of my resentment is the exact thing that renders it transient. This is the paradox: honesty about feeling our emotions—even those emotions considered non-productive—is itself what allows the emotion to dissipate. The honesty moves the emotion on. If I push my resentment down, it simply rebounds with greater vehemence. If I let the resentment rest at the top of my consciousness for a bit, it quickly floats into the ether and dissipates.
  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	I’m reminded of a section of my Civil Procedure casebook. When discussing jury selection, the author, Stephen Yeazell, discusses the paradox of bias. We are all biased, he says. But, it is those of us who are the most honest about the biases we do hold who end up being the least biased. 
  </div>
  <div class = "description">
	The same thing holds true in the context of those emotions considered unproductive: guilt, shame, grudges, victim self-blaming. We are all going to feel these emotions from time to time, just like we are all biased. To pretend that we aren’t is to pretend that we aren’t human. But, the more honesty we can bring to the table about the way we’re feeling, about the bias we hold, the more we can see, be seen, and move on.
