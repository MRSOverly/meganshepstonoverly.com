Blog title: Back in the USA
<p>
    After spending a lot of time working on trying to get a visa to stay in Europe (from Europe), we decided it was best to come back to the United States and file for a visa from here. Our experience is that it's difficult to file from the country you want to stay in; the visa process is best tackled from one's home country.
<p>
    For us, that meant coming back to the states and making an appointment in Washington DC for the consulate to review our application documents. It also means that at our appointment we have to surrender our passports while they process the paperwork.

    This was a huge blow. Not only having to come back, but also the thought of giving up our passports for a month or two gave me some serious anxiety. I mean, we wouldn't even be able to go to Canada! Portugal was new and exciting, full of beautiful beaches, scenic hikes, and patient people. (When I'm driving now, I literally tell myself to have "Portuguese patience.") I thought having to come back to our life before travel would be depressing and difficult, that I would again feel like I was drowning for days, unable to break the patterns that feel so firmly entrenched in our family dynamic at home.

<p>
    But, it had to be done, and, as one friend wisely told me, it was going to be done in service of the long-game, for the greater good. So, the question became: how do I deal? What can I do in this situation to cope with what feels like a major setback? What is good about the United States?
</p>
<p>
    It took me a while to see past the haze of my resentment, but eventually I found an answer. People. That's what's good about the United States. In-laws who are thrilled to have you in their home, cousins who invite you along on their adventures, old friends from college, new friends from traveling, friends who know all of your emotional hang-ups and are happy to talk about them. Creative friends who draw a logo for your podcast, just for fun and without being asked. Friends you've known since your oldest was in pre-school. Neighbors who've always listened and helped you with anything you needed. A beautiful dog park community. Wise yoga teachers who have a gift for knowing just what to say. People who don't know you that well but still invite you along on their traveling adventures without blinking an eye.

    Here are some of the people we had the chance to see during our time in the United States:

    Our first stop was my husband's parents' house. Grandma and grandpa live in a beautiful home in southwest Ohio that they designed and built; our kids absolutely love spending time there. Our son has the opportunity to learn how to weld from his grandpa, our daughter loves to create art with her grandma. Everyone gets to be in the garden and walk in the woods. The grandparents are always up for an unschooling adventure, and when our son told us he wanted to figure out a way to calculate the height and speed of their model rockets, they made it happen with joy and ease.

    This is my husband's cousin, Angie, and one of her kiddos with us. Angie was super kind to invite us along on her adventures while we were in Cincinnati. We went to Friendship Park, Smael Park, and swam at Zettler Pool. Angie is a multi-talented creator, as she is skilled as a seamstress, fine artist, and chef. Angie taught me how to mince an onion, and so, I think of her every time I make chili.

    These are our friends Brianne and Suzanne. Suzanne just became a published author! Her first book is available, check it out here: LINK. Brianne is an out-of-the-box thinking, accomplished engineer, general creative awesome person who currently welds in her free time, and is the best aunt ever. She is one of our oldest friends. Brianne is that friend who is always coming up with fun ideas to go adventuring, whether it's climbing a ridiculous amount of stairs, spending a couple days in New York, or singing some karaoke, no one is more fun to hang with.

    This is Zara and her kids, our new friends we met traveling. Zara is a real-estate investor and manager, homeschooling mom, former fitness instructor, taught in South America, has a biology degree, and speaks excellent Spanish. We met this spring in Portugal, and I loved going on weekly hikes with Zara. She would plan for something new and interesting every week, and all I had to do was follow along. She told me, "if you follow me we may get lost," and I responded, "I'm good with that."
